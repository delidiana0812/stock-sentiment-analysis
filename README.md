# stock-sentiment-analysis
In this project, I will analyze the sentiment towards stock movements using the RNN (Recurrent neural network) in Long short-term memory (LSTM) method. In the dataset used, a sentiment will have a value of 1 if it is a positive sentiment towards stock movements and will have a value of 0 if the opposite.
